# Formatting

Here is some dummy text to see how the page is laid out with the formatting
options.

## Code

```python
# Plotting.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plt(x=year, y=temp)
ax.set_xlabel('Year')
ax.set_ylabel('Temp')
plt.show()
```

```sh
mkdir data
mv results.csv data/results.csv
git add .
git commit -m "Move data to separate directory"
```

Here is some `code` intertwined with some `text.txt`. The formatting of `code`
should be easily discernible from `variables --options --values` while inline.

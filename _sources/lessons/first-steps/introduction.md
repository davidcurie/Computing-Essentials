# First Steps

```{admonition} Prerequisites
- Git-It Tutorial
```

```{topic} Objectives
- Become familiar with terminal execution
- Practice basic git commands
```

## Terminal

Why are terminal commands useful? -> Because they shorten the time you spend manipulating files.

Why would I spend time learning a complex set of commands when it easier to use a GUI tool supplied by my operating system?
    - GUI tools are limited in functionality in an effort to be simple to use
    - Don't _memorize_ commands. Outsource them to a script.

## Instructions

Navigate to `~/Computing-Essentials` in a terminal and execute the following commands:

```console
~/Computing-Essentials $ sh commands
```

Move to the newly created folder and view the contents with `ls`:

```console
~/Computing-Essentials $ cd first-steps
~/Computing-Essentials/first-steps $ ls
 122021_results.csv 122121_results.csv summary.csv 122021_high-temp_results.csv
```

### Create and rename 

1. Make a new folder somewhere:
2. 
```python
for file in files:
    print(file)
```
